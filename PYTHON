#Install python and anaconda (anaconda includes math packages for python)
#From pycharm, go to File > settings > projects > interpreter > select interpreter 
#If anaconda not there, add it by browsing from pycharm to anaconda3/python.exe
#Install R dependencies (http://irkernel.github.io/installation/)
#Install Markdown (pandoc) (https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/1.16.0.1)
#May or may not need (https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer/jupyter-and-conda-r)
#Download plotting.py from (http://resources.codingthematrix.com) for matrix work.
#PyCharm can remain installed.

#OPENING:

#Go to cmd command and type:

cd c:\Users\p\Documents\matrix       #If matrix is where we want to work from.

#Then type:

ipython notebook

Jupyter should open on Chrome, ready to play... File > New Notebook > select kernel or open existing notebooks.

Don't close cmd window during the session. To end type Ctrl + c

Each In[]: is a "cell". You can run the cells by pressing Ctrl + Return. Later, placing the cursor on the cell
it can be modified over and over to make it a full document onto itself. The drawback - it can't be run line by line.

#To start doing math with python type:

%pylab inline
x = linspace(0, 2 * pi, 500)
plot(x, sin(x))

## IN PYCHARM:

%pylab
x = linspace(0, 2 * pi, 500)
plot(x, sin(x))

# But if we want it to go to the browser:

from plotting import plot
L = [2 + 2j, 3 + 2j, 1.75 + 1j]
plot(L)

#To plot imaginary numbers:

from plotting import plot

#Should be able to work with Python, R, Markdown

#Save by downloading in any extension - it'll go to wherever the browser downloads, and then it can be moved to other folders.




import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.mlab as mlab

mean = 0
variance = 1
sigma = math.sqrt(variance)
x = np.linspace(-3,3,100)
plt.plot(x,mlab.normpdf(x,mean,sigma))

plt.show()
