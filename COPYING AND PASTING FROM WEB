# We go to the R console, and type: 

data=read.table(stdin(),header=TRUE, sep=",")

# Press return and Ctrl + V to paste

# Press return and let it do its job...

# Save it in the R directory like this:

write.csv(data, "name of the file.csv")

# Now it is accessible by just calling it through:

dat <- read.csv("psa.csv")
