# set up some data
x <- c(53.4, 59.0, 40.4, 51.9, 43.8, 43.0, 57.6)
y <- c(49.1, 57.9, 74.8, 46.8, 48.8, 43.7)

xyv <- stack(list(x=x,y=y))$values     # 53.4 59.0 40.4 51.9 43.8 43.0 57.6 49.1 57.9 74.8 46.8 48.8 43.7

nx  <- length(x)                       # 7

# do sample-x mean for all combinations for PERMUTATION TEST:
# the following puts together all the combinations (yes, combinations; not permutations, because we want unique means):

permmean = combn(xyv, nx, mean)        # Means of each combination mixing up the two vectors

# notice that 

choose(length(xyv), length(x))         # 1716 # the number of combinations of taken from the combined vector is equal to:
length(permmean)                       # 1716

# find p-value for permutation test:

# Left tail: percentage of means less than the mean of the first vector:
# the more there are, the more vector y is "diluting" by being significantly lower in average: H_a: y < x

left  = mean(permmean <= mean(x)) 

# Right tail: H_a: y > x. In other words, y raises the mean as compared to x. 
# If the lower cutoff limit is mean(x) the distance from the mean(xyv) is mean(xyv) - mean(x)
# and we want the same distance on the positive side: mean(xyv) + (mean(xyv) - mean(x))
# which is 3 * mean(xyv) - mean(x)

right = mean(permmean >= (mean(xyv) * 2 - mean(x)))
pvalue_perm = left + right
"Permutation test p-value"; pvalue_perm
# [1] "Permutation test p-value" [1] 0.5378788

# this is easier: 
     pvalue = mean(abs(permmean - mean(xyv)) >= abs(mean(x)-mean(xyv))) # 0.5378788
# but I'd keep left and right above for adapting to other tests


# Do the equivalent resampling for a RANDOMIZATION TEST:
# here we sample and take the mean, which by default comes without replacement (with replacement is bootstrapping):

randmean <- replicate(100000, mean(sample(xyv, nx)))

# find p-value for randomization test
left  = mean(randmean <= mean(x))
right = mean(randmean>=(mean(xyv)*2 - mean(x)))
pvalue_rand = left + right
"Randomization test p-value"; pvalue_rand
# [1] "Randomization test p-value" [1] 0.5402

# Draw a display to show distn & p-vale region for both
